                <p>Greetings, my name is Shane Kunkle. I'm a tall skinny guy who lives in a small urban neighborhood in Baltimore, MD – just a few blocks from the inner harbor with my wonderful wife and faithful dog.</p>
                <p>I spend a lot of time in front of the computer and a lot of time watching sports – especially the Philadelphia Eagles and Virginia Tech Hokies.  I love the outdoors and try to get in a few backpacking trips each year including an annual weeklong trip out west – in 2007 the wife and I found ourselves in <a href="http://www.nps.gov/olym/photosmultimedia/index.htm" target="_blank">Olympic National Park</a> and I’ve already purchased plane tickets to Jackson Hole to hike thru the <a href="http://www.windriverrange.com/" target="_blank">Wind River Range</a> in September of 2008</p>
                <a href="http://vt.FanFoc.us" target="_blank" style="float:right;margin-top:25px;"><img alt="vt.FanFoc.us - a sports community dedicated to Virginia Tech sports and controlled by its fans" src="images/vt.gif" style="border:none;" /></a>
                <h3 style="margin-top:50px;">Personal Work</h3>
                <p>Software is not only my job <em>(more on that later)</em> – it’s also my hobby. I am fascinated by the wisdom of crowds and the power found in online communities. I believe that if you provide powerful tools to passionate users the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. </p>
                <p>These interests and my love of sports have become strange bedfellows as I’ve been working on a new type of online sports community called <a href="http://vt.FanFoc.us" target="_blank">vt.FanFoc.us</a> - dedicated to Virginia Tech football and controlled by its fans.  FanFoc.us allows users to share their favorite stuff from anywhere on the internet and talk about the team.  The community as a whole decides what is best and you get more credibility the more you participate.  Since the site was launched in September of 2007 it’s been a cool and fun experiment.</p>
                <p>Please check out <a href="http://vt.fanfoc.us/en/Contact.2.aspx" target="_blank">my blog on vt.FanFoc.us</a> out and let me know what you think!</p>

                <h3 style="margin-top:50px;">Professional Career</h3>
                <p>I am the senior developer at <a href="http://www.caudillweb.com" target="_blank">Caudill Website Design and Construction, Inc</a> in Washington, DC and a Microsoft Certified Engineer in asp.net.  We specialize in leveraging the latest Microsoft technologies to build complete website solutions.  In technical terms – we use asp.net ajax for client side development, vb.net for server side development and sql server for our database.  In layman’s terms – I make up half of the best small web design company on the internet today.</p>
                <p>Our first goal is to build a great website fits your organization perfectly.  We build every customer a website completely from scratch – designed around your needs.  We’ve developed so many different websites for our customers – from large to small – in fact I can’t think of a solution we couldn’t build.</p>
                <p>Our second goal is to empower the customer – we try to make it easy for your staff to change any part of the website using our powerful editors. No technical knowledge or software required. We build software that makes it easy to publish an article on your website and then send it to all your eNewsletter subscribers with the click of a button – while in an internet café on a business trip. </p>
                <p>Please do not hesitate to <a href="http://www.caudillweb.com" target="_blank">contact me</a> - I’m always happy to answer questions or give advice. </p>
